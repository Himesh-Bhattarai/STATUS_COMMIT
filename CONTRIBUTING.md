# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in STATUS. The goal is to keep the system small, clear, and easy to adopt.

## Commit Messages
- Use `STATUS(###): summary` on the first line.
- Keep the summary under 72 characters when possible.
- Use `STATUS(203)` for documentation-only changes.
- Use `STATUS(102)` for work that is not finished.

## Proposing New Codes
- Open an issue with the problem you want to solve.
- Explain why an existing code is insufficient.
- Include 2 or 3 real examples.

## Pull Requests
- Keep changes focused and small.
- Update `README.md` and `status-codes.json` if you change codes.
- Run the hook locally when you can.
- Preserve the attribution lines in `README.md` and `NOTICE`.

## Development
No build steps are required right now.
